# Grocery-store-analysis- (E-commerce)

This project focuses on analyzing sales data for an online grocery store to provide insights into sales performance across various product and outlet categories. The analysis was performed using Power BI, combining data cleansing, modeling, and visualization techniques to meet business requirements.

## Overview
The Grocery Store Sales Analysis project aims to provide comprehensive insights into sales patterns and outlet performance. By developing an interactive dashboard using Power BI and performing data cleansing and modeling, key business questions related to sales, product attributes, and outlet characteristics were addressed.

## Key Metrics
- Total Sales: Overall sales performance across all outlets and product types.
- Average Sales: The average sales per transaction or outlet.
- Number of Items Sold: Total number of items sold across different outlets and product categories.
- Average Ratings: Product ratings across different categories.
- Total Sales by Fat Content/Item Type: An analysis of how fat content (low, medium, high) affects sales across different item types.
- Sales and Fat Content by Outlet Size: Correlation between outlet size (small, medium, large) and total sales/fat content.
- Sales by Outlet Type: Comparative sales performance between various types of outlets (e.g., supermarket, grocery chain).
- Sales by Outlet Location: Location-wise breakdown of sales performance.

## Tools Used
- Power BI: For creating an interactive and user-friendly dashboard with visualizations.
- Power Query: Used to clean and transform raw grocery store sales data.
- SQL: Performed SQL queries to explore and validate data.
- Data Modeling: Defined relationships between different data points like outlets, items, and sales to ensure accurate insights.

## Key Features
- Data Cleansing: Cleaned the dataset to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicate entries.
- Interactive Dashboards: Designed intuitive visuals such as bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to communicate the insights.
- Drill-Down Capabilities: Enabled users to filter and explore sales data by outlet size, type, and location.
- Metrics Comparison: Compared metrics such as total sales, number of items sold, and average ratings across different categories like item type and outlet characteristics.

## Visualizations
- Total Sales by Item Type: Displays the total sales performance across different product categories (dairy, beverages, etc.).
- Sales by Fat Content: Highlights sales distribution based on fat content (low, medium, high) and how it varies by item type.
- Sales by Outlet Size and Type: Analyzes sales based on the outlet’s size and its operational type (supermarket, small store, etc.).
- Sales by Outlet Location: A geographical breakdown of outlet sales to track performance across different regions.

## Conclusion
This analysis helps uncover critical insights about the grocery store's performance, offering valuable information to decision-makers for improving product offerings, optimizing outlet performance, and enhancing customer satisfaction. By using Power BI’s powerful visualization features and integrating data modeling, this project delivers a full-scale view of the store's sales data.
